Some notes:

1. Event number histograms scale:
- Scale(1/total event number), to get a event yield histogram
- Scale(36300*xsec), which is luminosity * cross section
- Scale(1/BinWidth), so the height will not change with bin width

2. Currently need to focus on dielectron channel, the dimuon pt information is missing

3. There's a no-match in low pt histogram, need to consider whether to scale the histograms later!

4.
